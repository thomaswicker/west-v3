	<p class="marketsBodyText markets-details-spacer">WEST scientists have many years of experience in supporting oil and gas exploration and development projects throughout various states. Our approach and support on mineral development projects remains consistent regardless of whether the client has a single well or full field development.</p>
	WEST has several experienced biologists and botanists on staff to conduct biological surveys or habitat assessments to support agency permitting of oil and gas projects. WEST staff are knowledgeable of standardized protocols or can develop project specific methods to obtain precise data on the wildlife use of an area proposed for development. We can identify potential adverse effects that may occur to individuals or populations and suggest mitigation to minimize these effects.</p>
	<p class="marketsBodyText">During maintenance and operation of oil and gas facilities, WEST routinely conducts surveys to evaluate wildlife response to oil and gas development. Survey requirements are typically established by in agencies as a permit condition and WEST staff knowledge of specific seasonal or timing requirements ensures that data is collected according to established protocols with minimal disturbance to individuals or populations.</p>
	<p class="marketsSubTitle">Service Areas</p>
	With offices throughout the United States, WEST is well situated to serve the oil and gas industry.  We have permanent locations in Cheyenne, WY; Bismarck, ND; Austin, TX and Bloomington, IN in addition to numerous field offices in key areas such as the Texas panhandle and the Front Range of Colorado.
	<p class="marketsBodyText">Representative baseline surveys to determine occurrence (presence/absence) of federally listed species or their critical habitats within areas proposed for development.</p>

	<p class="marketsSubTitle">National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</p>

	<ul class="marketsList">
		<li><strong>Permitting</strong>
			WEST scientists have extensive experience in permitting point source discharges under Section 402 the Clean Water Act. For example, our staff has drafted and submitted over 100 Wyoming National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WYPDES) permit applications, modifications and renewals to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) for conventional oil well and coal bed natural gas projects throughout Wyoming.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul class="marketsList">
			<li><strong>Monitoring and Compliance Reporting</strong>
				In addition to permitting discharges, WEST staff can also conduct routine permit compliance sampling, monitoring and reporting as established by the individual or general permits. WEST can provide efficient and cost effective monitoring programs to ensure oil and gas operators remain in compliance with permit conditions. Our field staff is proficient in collecting outfall samples, adhering to chain of custody requirements, reviewing analytical results for compliance with permit conditions, and submitting results to federal and state agencies. WEST can develop plan-of-actions to promptly address compliance issues or formal enforcement actions.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="marketsList">
				<li><strong>Storm Water Permitting, Monitoring and Compliance Reporting</strong>
					WEST scientists provide support for oil and gas facilities compliance with storm water discharge permitting and monitoring. Scientists have drafted or aided clients in drafting and submitting Notice of Intents for single wells or field wide storm water permits. WEST has drafted Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans, performed routine inspections during various phases of construction and reclamation, and submitted Notice of Terminations for facilities meeting re-vegetation requirements.

					<p class="marketsSubTitle">We offer experience in Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan inspection services to our oil and gas clients. The inspections are structured to help keep clients in compliance with current regulations and permit requirements. Any non-compliance issues are promptly identified and reported to the clients to minimize impacts to the environment.<strong></li>
						<li><strong>Compliance Audits</strong>
							WEST scientists have performed NPDES compliance audits for energy clients to evaluate conformance with the NPDES program and permits issued to the operators. Audits are structured to evaluate both internal and subcontractor operations to ensure compliance with individual or general permit conditions, identify areas of regulatory and environmental liability, and offer solutions to mitigate or eliminate these liabilities.</li>
						</ul>
						&nbsp;

						<hr style="border: 1px solid #dddddd;" />
						<p class="marketsSubTitle">Reclamation Plans</p>
						We have prepared reclamation plans for oil and gas projects in accordance with federal land management agency policy. Baseline soil and vegetative data is collected to develop site specific reclamation plans to conform to agency requirements.

						Post-construction vegetation density and diversity studies are conducted to evaluate reclamation success. Noxious weeds and invasive plants management plans are developed with operators to minimize the opportunity for weeds to move into disturbed areas. Plan are developed to describe methods to control and prevent further spread.
